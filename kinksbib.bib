@article{manton-paper,
	Abstract = {In a scalar field theory with a symmetric octic potential having a quartic minimum and two quadratic minima, kink solutions have long-range tails. We calculate the force between two kinks and between a kink and an antikink when their long-range tails overlap. This is a nonlinear problem, solved using an adiabatic ansatz for the accelerating kinks that leads to a modified, first-order Bogomolny equation. We find that the kink--kink force is repulsive and decays with the fourth power of the kink separation. The kink--antikink force is attractive and decays similarly. Remarkably, the kink--kink repulsion has four times the strength of the kink--antikink attraction.},
